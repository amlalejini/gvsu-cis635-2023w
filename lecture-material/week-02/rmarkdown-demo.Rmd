Some overview text that introduces this very interesting document. 

## This is a heading!

You should use headings to differentiate sections of your R markdown document. 

Here's a code chunk:
```{r}
price <- 500
tax <- 0.06
```

The price of the thing we want to buy is `r price`, and the tax rate is `r tax`.

```{r}
total <- price + (tax*price)
```
