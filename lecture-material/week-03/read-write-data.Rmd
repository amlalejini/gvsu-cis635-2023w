# Reading and Writing Data

You can download the R Markdown file used to generate this document (or webpage) [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amlalejini/gvsu-cis635-2023w/main/lecture-material/week-03/read-write-data.Rmd).
Download that Rmd file, open it own your own computer in RStudio, and run the code chunks on your own (and modify things as you wish!).

In this tutorial:

- I'll walk you through how to write data stored in a dataframe as a `.csv` file.
- And, I'll show you how to load data saved in a `.csv` file into a dataframe.

## Writing data

R comes preloaded with many datasets (for a complete list run `library(help="datasets")`).
For example, `Orange` is a small data set that gives growth data for 5 orange trees.

```{r}
head(Orange)
```

If we wanted to write this dataset out to a csv file, we could use the `write.csv` function.

```{r}
write.csv(x=Orange, file="orange_trees.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

If you run the above R code, where did `orange_trees.csv` get saved? (hint: in your current working directory)

`write.csv` has many options. Run `?write.csv` in your R console to read the documentation.

`write.csv` will be very useful when you want to clean up or transform a dataset that you'll be analyzing/working with.
If your dataset is large and/or the preprocessing operations you perform are expensive, you don't want do those operations every time you load your dataset.
Instead, write a script to process the dataset and save the processed dataset.

## Loading data

Loading data from a csv file is straightfoward. You'll use the `read.csv` function.

```{r, relative-path}
pokemon_df <- read.csv(file="lecture-material/week-03/data/pokemon.csv")
head(pokemon_df)
```

One slightly tricky thing to keep in mind about loading data is where R will look for the data you're loading.
This affects how you specify the `file` argument when you call `read.csv`.
You can always specify the complete file path, for example (on _my_ computer):

```{r, absolute-path}
pokemon_df <- read.csv(file="/Users/lalejina/class_ws/cis635-2023w/gvsu-cis635-2023w/lecture-material/week-03/data/pokemon.csv")
head(pokemon_df)
```

Often, it'll be easier to specify a _relative_ path.
In RStudio, when you do not specify a complete path, paths are relative to your current working directory.
Run `getwd()` to see what your current working directory is set to.
Use `setwd` to change your working directory.
