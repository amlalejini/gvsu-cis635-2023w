# Using tidyr to create tidy data

You can download the R Markdown file used to generate this document (or webpage) [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amlalejini/gvsu-cis635-2023w/main/lecture-material/week-03/tidyr.Rmd).
I would encourage you to download that Rmd file, open it own your own computer in RStudio, and run the code chunks on your own (and modify things as you wish!).


Goals:

- Work through examples of using tidyr (and dplyr) functions to clean up messy (un-tidy) data

Sources:

- <https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html>
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)

## Setup

You should have already installed the `tidyverse` collection of packages, which includes the tidyr package.
But, if you haven't, go ahead and run:

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

In this document, we'll be using the tidyr and dplyr packages.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```

## Overview

If you have not already, I suggest that you read the following article for an introduction to tidy data: <https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html>.
Additionally, I suggest that you work through the dplyr R Markdown material before working through this document.

The tidyr package provides functions for making messy data "tidy".
For a complete list of the included functions, see <https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html>.

Understanding tidy data and how to reformat your data into a tidy format is very important, as many of the functions/packages that we will use this semester are written to work with tidy-format data.
For example, ggplot (the R graphics package that we will be using) assumes tidy data.
Taking the time now to get comfortable with what it means to have tidy data will save you substantial time later on.

## What is tidy data?

You can represent the same underlying data many ways.
For example, let's say we have the following data about students' grades:

```{r}
messy_grade_data1 <- read.csv("lecture-material/week-03/data/messy_grades_1.csv", na.strings="")
messy_grade_data1
```

Or, the same exact data could be structured as follows:

```{r}
messy_grade_data2 <- read.csv("lecture-material/week-03/data/messy_grades_2.csv", na.strings="")
messy_grade_data2
```

Neither of these formats are particularly convenient to work with.
For example, in `messy_grade_data2` format, it would be difficult to query the full set of student names in the dataset (because each student has their own column).
Likewise, in `messy_grade_data1`, it would be diffult to query the set of assessments.

From <https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html>,

> A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitative). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes.

A tidy version of the grade data would look something like this:

```{r}
tidy_grade_data <- messy_grade_data1 %>%
  pivot_longer(c(quiz1,quiz2,test1), names_to="assessment", values_to="grade")
tidy_grade_data
```

This arrangement makes the values, variables, and observations clearer.
What are the values, variables, and observations in the grade data?
(the answer is [here](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html#data-semantics)).

A dataset is tidy if:

1. Each variable has its own column
2. Each observation has its own row
3. Each value has its own cell

In the grade data, we have the following variables: student name, assessment, and grade.
Each observation is a particular student's grade on a particular assessment (e.g., Jenny's grade on test1).
Each cell in the dataset specifies a value for a particular variable (e.g., in row 1 of `tidy_grade_data`, Billy is the value of the name variable).

## Making data tidy

Two common ways that data is messy:

1. Column headers are values, not variable names
2. Multiple variables are stored in one column

For more common ways that data are often messy, see: <https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html#tidying>

Below, are datasets that exemplify each problem.

### Column headers are values, not variables

Observations over time are often recorded in a "wide" format.
That is, each timepoint that an observation is made is entered as a column.
This is convienient for data entry.
For example, imagine you measure the temperature of a lake at several different depths over a 10 week period (one measurement for each depth every week).
It's convenient to enter that data in a "wide" format where each week is a column.
However, this is not tidy, as each row is no longer a single observation.

The `billboard` dataset that is loaded when you load the `tidyr` package is exemplifies this problem.

```{r}
billboard
```

The `billboard` dataset records the date a song enters the billboard top 100.
First on your own, use the `pivot_longer` function to create a tidy version of the `billboard` dataset.
The solution can be found [here](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html#column-headers-are-values-not-variable-names).

### Multiple variables are stored in one column

Sometimes, the values in a column describe multiple variables.
For example, in the following messy dataset, the month and day of each temperature recording are combined under a single column.

```{r}
messy_temperature <- read.csv("lecture-material/week-03/data/multi_variables_single_col.csv")
messy_temperature
```

The first three characters of the "date" column give the month, and the following numeric value gives the day of the month of the temperature reading.

We can use the `separate` function to properly split the date column into multiple columns.

```{r}
tidy_temperature <- messy_temperature %>% separate(col=date, into=c("month","day"), sep=3)
tidy_temperature
```

Run `?separate` to see how the separate function works.

Adding extra columns doesn't "untidy" your data.
Sometimes it is useful to add additional aggregate labels to an observation (especially when working with dates).
For example, it might be useful to add a proper date column (with the format YEAR-MONTH-DAY) to our tidied temperature data.
I'll leave that as an exercise for you to do on your own.
You'll need to map each month string to its numeric representation (e.g. jan = 1, feb = 2).
Then you can use `mutate` to create a new column from the relevant columns.
