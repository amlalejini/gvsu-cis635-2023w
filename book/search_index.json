You clearly indicate which question each of your responses are associated with. Part A., 10% Part B., 30% Part C., 50% 2.1.3 Deliverables .pdf file with your responses 2.2 Part A. Syllabus Read the course syllabus (posted on blackboard). For this question (on the document that you turn in), confirm that you have read the syllabus. Read the academic honesty policy for the GVSU School of Computing: https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm. For this question (on the document that you turn in), confirm that you have read the academic honesty policy. 2.3 Part B. Attribute descriptions You are given a data file (see assignment attachments on blackboard): hw01data.csv. This is a table of ratings for teaching assistants (TA) at some university (this is modified data that originally came from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php). There are 6 attributes: id: unique number to identify each rating instructor: id number that identifies the instructor classNbr: id number that identifies the course semester: 1=summer, 2=fall, 3=winter classSize: number of students in the class rating: 1=low, 2=medium, 3=high For each attribute, describe whether it is nominal or ordinal. id instructor classNbr semester classSize rating 2.4 Part C. Thinking about common data mining applications This question asks you to think about clustering. Considering an average kitchen, identify 4 clusters of objects. Name them according to their utility. For example, if I were asked to identify 4 clusters in a sporting goods store, I might choose apparel (e.g., shoes, shirts), containers (e.g., backpacks, coolers), sports equipment (e.g., basketball, tennis racquets), and fishing (e.g., rods, lures). Pick one of the following forms of predictive modeling: regression, classification, or ranking. Describe an application domain or a dataset where you think it would be useful to apply the chosen predictive modeling approach. What attribute(s) would you be predicting? What attributes would you use to make the prediction?
