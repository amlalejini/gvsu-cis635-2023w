For this question (on the document that you turn in), confirm that you have read and agree to abide by the academic honesty policy. 2.3 Part B. Attribute descriptions You are given a data file (see assignment attachments on blackboard): hw01data.csv. This is a table of ratings for teaching assistants (TA) at some university (this is modified data that originally came from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php). There are 6 attributes: id: unique number to identify each rating instructor: id number that identifies the instructor classNbr: id number that identifies the course semester: 1=summer, 2=fall, 3=winter classSize: number of students in the class rating: 1=low, 2=medium, 3=high For each attribute, describe whether it is nominal or ordinal. id instructor classNbr semester classSize rating 2.4 Part C. Thinking about common data mining applications This question asks you to think about clustering. Considering an average kitchen, identify 4 clusters of objects. Name them according to their utility. For example, if I were asked to identify 4 clusters in a sporting goods store, I might choose apparel (e.g., shoes, shirts), containers (e.g., backpacks, coolers), sports equipment (e.g., basketball, tennis racquets), and fishing (e.g., rods, lures). Pick one of the following forms of predictive modeling: regression, classification, or ranking. Describe an application domain or a dataset where you think it would be useful to apply the chosen predictive modeling approach. What attribute(s) would you be predicting? What attributes would you use to make the prediction?

This enables us to write nicely formatted documents with R code (and output from your R code) embedded directly in the document. Find examples of compiled R markdown documents here: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html In fact, this page is generated with R Markdown! Source code for this page here. 3.1 Dependencies To use R markdown, you’ll need to install the following packages: markdown and rmarkdown. You should also want to go ahead and install the tinytex package (+ install TinyTex) to be able generate PDF output from your R Markdown documents. See the instructions below! 3.1.1 Installing R packages As previously mentioned, there are many R packages (&gt; 18,000!) with all sorts of useful functionality. To install an R package, use the install.packages function in your R console (e.g., in RStudio). Run ?install.packages in your R console to read its help page. To install the markdown and rmarkdown packages, run the following command in your R console: install.packages(c(&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;)) Once the installations finish, you should be able to run the following two commands without errors: library(markdown) library(rmarkdown) For this class, you’ll also need to be able to generate PDF output from your R Markdown documents. To do so, you’ll need to instal LaTex (if you’re not sure what that is, no worries!). Run the following two commands in your R console in RStudio: install.packages(&#39;tinytex&#39;) tinytex::install_tinytex() 3.2 Create a new R Markdown document in RStudio Click the new file button in the top right of the RStudio window, and select R Markdown. In RStudio, you should get a pop-up for creating a new r markdown document. For now, there are two relevant options: Click the “Create Empty Document” in the bottom left of the popup. This will create an empty R markdown file for you. Fill out the title, author (you!), and date fields and press “Okay”. This will create a new R markdown file, but RStudio will initialize your file with a bunch of stuff (this stuff is helpful information, but you will want to delete it all for any assignments in this class). 3.3 Anatomy of an R Markdown document There are three basic components in an R Markdown document: the metadata, text, and code. Here’s the contents for a minimal R Markdown document (from https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html): An R Markdown document should be a plain text file (i.e., don’t try to write one in google docs or microsoft word!) and conventionally has the .Rmd file extension. 3.3.1 Frontmatter (metadata) The metadata (or the frontmatter) specifies how your R Markdown should be compiled. E.g., the output file type, whether to include a table of contents, etc. The metadata should be written between a pair of three dashes --- at the top of your document (see minimal example). For now, don’t worry too much about what you should include in your document metadata. For the most part, you can just use what RStudio includes in your document. 3.3.2 Text The body of your document follows the metadata. Any text (i.e., everything that isn’t code) you include in your document should follow markdown syntax. If you’re not already familiar with markdown, read over this: https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started. For basic markdown syntax, see: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/. Being familiar with basic syntax should be just about everything you need for your homework assignments in this class. For more advanced markdown syntax, see: https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/. You can also refer to Section 2.5 in R Markdown: The Definitive Guide for more info on markdown. 3.3.3 Code In general, you can include code in your R Markdown documents in two ways: Inline code begin with `r and end with a `. E.g., 2 would render the result of log(4, base=2) inline. You can include a “code chunk” inside your R Markdown document. A code chunk begins with three backticks ```{r} and end with three backticks (see minimal example above for an example). There are many options tha tyou can specify in the {} at the beginning of a code chunk. See https://yihui.org/knitr/options/ for details. 3.4 “Knitting” To compile an R Markdown document into a PDF or HTML file, you need to “Knit” it. In RStudio, this is pretty straightforward. Just click the “Knit” button on your document in RStudio. 3.5 Resources R Markdown: The Definitive Guide Code chunk options: https://yihui.org/knitr/options/ "],["homework-2.html", "Chapter 4 Homework 2 4.1 Overview 4.2 Setup 4.3 Part A.

Types of data", " Chapter 4 Homework 2 4.1 Overview This goal of this homework is as follows: Give you an opportunity to practice some R programming basics Make sure you are comfortable with using markdown syntax to format an R markdown document Make sure you are comfortable creating and knitting an R markdown document into a pdf I recommend that you get started with this assignment early so that you can come to office hours to get help with any issues you have knitting your Rmd document into a pdf. 4.1.1 Grading Uploaded requested files, 10% File is properly/clearly formatted, 10% Proper section headers for each part of your homework You clearly indicate which question each of your responses is associated with Look at your compiled pdf before submitting it. Make sure it looks well-formatted. For this assignment, formatting is particularly important because it’s something you’ll need to know how to do well in R markdown going forward. Programming questions: 80%, all weighted evenly 4.1.2 Deliverables .pdf file (generated by knitting your .Rmd file) .Rmd file (used to generate your pdf file) 4.2 Setup Make sure you have access to a computer with R and RStudio installed (with the ability to install new packages). If you do not, let me know as soon as possible! If you have not done so already, install R and RStudio (step-by-step guides provided in week 1 course content). I strongly encourage you to stay organized. I recommend that you directory on your computer where you can save all of your work for this class (e.g., “cis635” would make for a good name). Within that directory, I recommend keeping each of your homework assignments and projects separated into their own directories. For example, I might organize things as follows: cis635/ homeworks/ hw01 hw02 ... project/ ... Create a new R Markdown file with the title “Homework 2” and with you as the author (hint: this information will go into your R Markdown frontmatter at the top of the file). In your R markdown file, create a section heading for each of the following parts of your homework: Part A. Use R as a calculator Part B. Built-in Functions Part C. Creating vectors Part D. Subsetting vectors Part E. Types of data 4.3 Part A. Use R as a calculator Under your Part A heading, write one code chunk for each of the following calculations: \\[ 1+2(3+4) \\] \\[ log_2(4^3 + 3^{2+1}) \\] \\[ \\sqrt{(4+3)(2+1)} \\] For example, if the calculation is 2 + 2, your code chunk should look something like this when your R Markdown document is compiled: 2+2 ## [1] 4 I want to see each equation translated directly into code. Do not simplify any of the calculations (e.g., 2+1 should be 2+1 in your code, not 3). 4.4 Part B. Built-in Functions A built-in function is one that comes pre-loaded in R (you don’t need to install and load a package to use). To learn how to use a built-in loaded function that you don’t know how to use appropriately, use the help() function. help() takes one parameter, the name of the function that you want information about (e.g., help(abs)). Instead of the help function, you could also use enter ? and then the name of the function in your R console (e.g., ?abs). Familiarize yourself with the built-in functions abs(), round(), sqrt(), tolower(), and toupper(). Under your Part B heading, use these built-in functions to write code that prints the following items (put each of these into a different code chunk in your R Markdown document): The absolute value of -15.5. 4.483847 rounded to one decimal place. The function round() takes two arguments, the number to be rounded and the number of decimal places. “species” in all capital letters. “SPECIES” in all lower case letters. 4.5 Part C. Creating vectors Under your Part C heading, Create the following vectors using just seq() and/or rep(). (don’t use c()) Positive integers from 1 to 99 Odd integers between 1 and 99 The numbers 1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3 (hint: read the help pages for seq and rep!) 4.6 Part D. Subsetting vectors Under your Part D heading, use subsetting syntax (square brackets) to write code that completes the following using the vector y. y &lt;- c(3,2,15,-1,22,1,9,17,5) Display only the first value of y. Display the last value of y, in a way that would work if y were any length. (hint: ?length) Display only the values in y that are greater than the mean of y. 4.7 Part E. Types of data Under your part E heading, using the vector y write code that completes the following tasks: y &lt;- c(3,2,15,-1,22,1,9,17,5) Make a logical (TRUE/FALSE) vector describing which values in y are positive. Make a logical vector describing whether any of the values of y are equal to the mean of y. Coerce the vector you just made (in #2 above) from a logical vector to a character vector. Make a logical vector describing whether any of the values of y are equal to the median of y. Coerce the vector you just made (in #4 above) into a categorial vector (using factor()). Make a matrix with 4 rows and 3 columns that looks like this: ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 3 ## [2,] 4 5 6 ## [3,] 7 8 9 ## [4,] 10 11 12 Coerce that matrix into a dataframe.

I would encourage you to download that Rmd file, open it own your own computer in RStudio, and run the code chunks on your own (and modify things as you wish!). In this tutorial, We’ll go over argument order and default values when calling functions in R We’ll go over the basics of writing functions in R 6.1 Argument order and default values As you encountered last week, R has many built-in functions (e.g., abs, round, etc), and all of R packages that you install provide even more functions that you can use. Using an existing function is simple. Write the name of the function you want to use followed by the requisite arguments in parentheses. For example, value &lt;- -15 abs(value) ## [1] 15 or, log(4, base=2) ## [1] 2 If you look at the documentation for abs (enter ?abs into your R console), there’s only one argument (x), and x is required (i.e., notice that it has no default values). In contrast, run ?log function in your R console. Notice that there are two possible arguments for log, x and base. x is required, as it has no default value, but base is optional, defaulting to exp(1) if not provided. Let’s say we want to take the \\(log_3\\) of 27. To do so, we’ll need to specify both the x and base arguments, but there are a few ways that we can do that. For example, we could call log with each argument in the correct position: log(27, 3) ## [1] 3 We could call log as I did above with log(4, base=2): log(27, base=3) ## [1] 3 In this case, R relies on argument position to deduce which argument is which up until the first named variable. We could also specify all arguments using their names: log(x=27, base=3) ## [1] 3 If you specify arguments this way (using their names), argument order doesn’t matter. log(base=3, x=27) ## [1] 3 When calling a function with multiple arguments, I strongly encourage you to specify arguments by name. 6.2 Writing your own functions To write a function in R, the general structure is as follows: my_function &lt;- function(parameters) { # Perform some actions using the given parameters. # Optionally, return some value } We can write a function that rolls a die for us like so: # This function rolls a six-sided die. # Run ?sample in your console if you&#39;re curious about how the sample function # works. roll &lt;- function() { result &lt;- sample(x = 1:6, size = 1, replace = TRUE) return(result) } Currently, roll_d6 will always simulate rolling a six-sided die. We could modify our function definition to add an argument that specifies the size of the die: # This function simulates rolling a die with a given number of sides. roll &lt;- function(sides) { result &lt;- sample(x = 1:sides, size = 1, replace = TRUE) return(result) } Note that when we run the code chunk above, we are redefining our roll function. Challenge question: Try writing your own roll function that rolls an argument-specified number of dice (where the number of sides of each die is specified by an argument) and then returns the sum of those rolls. 6.3 Return values In the roll functions that we wrote, we explicitly specified what the functions should return. However, if you do not use return() to specify what should be returned, the last evaluated expression is returned automatically. If the last evaluated expression doesn’t produce a value, your function will not return a value. I generally prefer to use explicit return statements because it lets me quickly identify what my functions are returning. Here’s a silly function: silly_function &lt;- function(a) { if (a == 1) { a + 100 } else if (a == 2) { 200 } else if (a == 3) { return(300) } else { } } Try calling silly_function with different inputs to see what it returns. 6.4 Default argument values Just like many built-in functions have some arguments with defualt values, you can define your functions such their arguments have default values. All you need to do is specify the default value of an argument when you define the function. For example, if we wrote a function that calculates the price something with a sales tax included, we might specify a default tax rate for convenience. price_with_tax &lt;- function(price, tax_rate=0.06) { return(price+(price*tax_rate)) } 6.5 Resources Hands-on Programming with R (2.3, 2.4) Software carpentry lesson on writing functions in R "],["reading-and-writing-data.html", "Chapter 7 Reading and Writing Data 7.1 Writing data 7.2 Loading data", " Chapter 7 Reading and Writing Data You can download the R Markdown file used to generate this document (or webpage) here. Download that Rmd file, open it own your own computer in RStudio, and run the code chunks on your own (and modify things as you wish!). In this tutorial: I’ll walk you through how to write data stored in a dataframe as a .csv file. And, I’ll show you how to load data saved in a .csv file into a dataframe. 7.1 Writing data R comes preloaded with many datasets (for a complete list run library(help=\"datasets\")). For example, Orange is a small data set that gives growth data for 5 orange trees. head(Orange) ## Tree age circumference ## 1 1 118 30 ## 2 1 484 58 ## 3 1 664 87 ## 4 1 1004 115 ## 5 1 1231 120 ## 6 1 1372 142 If we wanted to write this dataset out to a csv file, we could use the write.csv function. write.csv(x=Orange, file=&quot;orange_trees.csv&quot;, row.names=FALSE) If you run the above R code, where did orange_trees.csv get saved? (hint: in your current working directory) write.csv has many options. Run ?write.csv in your R console to read the documentation. write.csv will be very useful when you want to clean up or transform a dataset that you’ll be analyzing/working with. If your dataset is large and/or the preprocessing operations you perform are expensive, you don’t want do those operations every time you load your dataset. Instead, write a script to process the dataset and save the processed dataset. 7.2 Loading data Loading data from a csv file is straightfoward. You’ll use the read.csv function. pokemon_df &lt;- read.csv(file=&quot;lecture-material/week-03/data/pokemon.csv&quot;) head(pokemon_df) ## abilities against_bug against_dark against_dragon ## 1 [&#39;Overgrow&#39;, &#39;Chlorophyll&#39;] 1.00 1 1 ## 2 [&#39;Overgrow&#39;, &#39;Chlorophyll&#39;] 1.00 1 1 ## 3 [&#39;Overgrow&#39;, &#39;Chlorophyll&#39;] 1.00 1 1 ## 4 [&#39;Blaze&#39;, &#39;Solar Power&#39;] 0.50 1 1 ## 5 [&#39;Blaze&#39;, &#39;Solar Power&#39;] 0.50 1 1 ## 6 [&#39;Blaze&#39;, &#39;Solar Power&#39;] 0.25 1 1 ## against_electric against_fairy against_fight against_fire against_flying ## 1 0.5 0.5 0.5 2.0 2 ## 2 0.5 0.5 0.5 2.0 2 ## 3 0.5 0.5 0.5 2.0 2 ## 4 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.5 1 ## 5 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.5 1 ## 6 2.0 0.5 0.5 0.5 1 ## against_ghost against_grass against_ground against_ice against_normal ## 1 1 0.25 1 2.0 1 ## 2 1 0.25 1 2.0 1 ## 3 1 0.25 1 2.0 1 ## 4 1 0.50 2 0.5 1 ## 5 1 0.50 2 0.5 1 ## 6 1 0.25 0 1.0 1 ## against_poison against_psychic against_rock against_steel against_water ## 1 1 2 1 1.0 0.5 ## 2 1 2 1 1.0 0.5 ## 3 1 2 1 1.0 0.5 ## 4 1 1 2 0.5 2.0 ## 5 1 1 2 0.5 2.0 ## 6 1 1 4 0.5 2.0 ## attack base_egg_steps base_happiness base_total capture_rate classfication ## 1 49 5120 70 318 45 Seed Pokémon ## 2 62 5120 70 405 45 Seed Pokémon ## 3 100 5120 70 625 45 Seed Pokémon ## 4 52 5120 70 309 45 Lizard Pokémon ## 5 64 5120 70 405 45 Flame Pokémon ## 6 104 5120 70 634 45 Flame Pokémon ## defense experience_growth height_m hp japanese_name name ## 1 49 1059860 0.7 45 Fushigidaneフシギダネ Bulbasaur ## 2 63 1059860 1.0 60 Fushigisouフシギソウ Ivysaur ## 3 123 1059860 2.0 80 Fushigibanaフシギバナ Venusaur ## 4 43 1059860 0.6 39 Hitokageヒトカゲ Charmander ## 5 58 1059860 1.1 58 Lizardoリザード Charmeleon ## 6 78 1059860 1.7 78 Lizardonリザードン Charizard ## percentage_male pokedex_number sp_attack sp_defense speed type1 type2 ## 1 88.1 1 65 65 45 grass poison ## 2 88.1 2 80 80 60 grass poison ## 3 88.1 3 122 120 80 grass poison ## 4 88.1 4 60 50 65 fire ## 5 88.1 5 80 65 80 fire ## 6 88.1 6 159 115 100 fire flying ## weight_kg generation is_legendary ## 1 6.9 1 0 ## 2 13.0 1 0 ## 3 100.0 1 0 ## 4 8.5 1 0 ## 5 19.0 1 0 ## 6 90.5 1 0 One slightly tricky thing to keep in mind about loading data is where R will look for the data you’re loading.

Use setwd to change your working directory.

All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. The tidyverse includes the following packages: ggplot2 - provides a system for creating graphics based on The Grammar of Graphics dplyr - provides functions for data manipulation tidyr - provides functions that help you turn your data into tidy data readr - provides fast functions for reading data from files forcats - provides functions for working with factors tibble - provides an alternative data structure (a tibble) to the data frame stringr - provides functions for working with strings purrr - provides tools for working with functions and vectors Install the tidyverse collection of packages using: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) While all of the tidyverse is useful for working with data (and worth spending time to learn), we’ll focus on the dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2 packages.

But, if you haven’t, go ahead and run: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) With the tidyverse packages installed, you’ll need to load the dplyr library to use it. library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union 9.4 Overview This document will cover key dplyr functions that solve the most common data manipulation challenges. The examples and explanations here non-exhaustive (dplyr has a lot of functionality and each of these functions are very flexible). Instead, I’d like you to start building a sense of the broad category of data manipulations that are possible with each of the dplyr functions below. As you encounter challenges with manipulating data, you should have a solid idea of which functions you will need to do what you want to do. Then, you can use those functions’ documentation to work out the specific details. dplyr’s functions for basic data manipulation can be divided into three categories based on the component of the dataset that they work with (descriptions pulled from dplyr documentation): Rows filter() - choose rows in your data based on their column values slice() - choose rows in your data based on their location (index) in the dataset arrange() - change the ordering of rows in your data Columns select() - changes whether or not a column is included rename() - changes the names of columns mutate() - changes the values of columns and can create new columns that are functions of existing columns relocate() - changes the order of columns Groups of rows summarise() - collapses a group of rows into a single row These functions can be used in combination with group_by(), which allows you to perform these functions on particular groups of rows, instead of the entire dataset. Note that the above list of functions is non-exhaustive. I refer you to the dplyr documentation for an exhaustive list. Additionally, I’d encourage you to look over (and save) the cheat sheet linked at the end of this document. 9.5 The pipe operator Most dplyr functions take a dataframe (or tibble) as their first argument. dplyr provides the pipe operator (%&gt;%), which lets you conveniently compose multiple dplyr functions in a single line (instead of needing to save intermediate states of your dataset). The pipe operator “pipes” the results of the left side of the pipe into the first argument of the right side of the pipe. Here’s an example: f &lt;- function(a, b) { return(a + b) } g &lt;- function(a, b) { return(a * b) } x &lt;- 2 y &lt;- 100 x %&gt;% f(y) # Is the same as f(x,y) ## [1] 102 x %&gt;% f(y) %&gt;% g(y) # Is the same as g(f(x,y), y) ## [1] 10200 9.6 Data We’ll use the starwars dataset to demonstrate the basic data manipulation functions provided by dplyr. You don’t need to download anything, the starwars dataset is loaded when you load the dplyr package. dim(starwars) ## [1] 87 14 This dataset has 87 rows and 14 columns where each row represents a character from Star Wars, and each column is a particular attribute. starwars ## # A tibble: 87 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywa… 172 77 blond fair blue 19 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… Tatooi… ## 3 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red 33 none mascu… Naboo ## 4 Darth Vader 202 136 none white yellow 41.9 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 5 Leia Organa 150 49 brown light brown 19 fema… femin… Aldera… ## 6 Owen Lars 178 120 brown,… light blue 52 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 7 Beru White… 165 75 brown light blue 47 fema… femin… Tatooi… ## 8 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red NA none mascu… Tatooi… ## 9 Biggs Dark… 183 84 black light brown 24 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 10 Obi-Wan Ke… 182 77 auburn… fair blue-g… 57 male mascu… Stewjon ## # … with 77 more rows, 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ## # ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld If you look closely at the above output, you’ll notice that the starwars dataset is represented as a tibble. A tibble is a more modern version of the dataframe type, and for the most part, anywhere you could use a dataframe, you can use a tibble. You can convert a data frame to tibbles with the as_tible() function. Read more about tibbles here: https://tibble.tidyverse.org/. 9.7 Filter rows with filter() filter() allows you to choose rows in a data frame based on their column values. For example, if we wanted to create a new data frame that only contained droids, we could: starwars %&gt;% filter(species==&quot;Droid&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 × 14 ## name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_c…¹ birth…² sex gender homew…³ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, bl… red 33 none mascu… Naboo ## 3 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, red red NA none mascu… Tatooi… ## 4 IG-88 200 140 none metal red 15 none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 R4-P17 96 NA none silver, r… red, b… NA none femin… &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 BB8 NA NA none none black NA none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## # … with 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, ## # starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​eye_color, ²​birth_year, ## # ³​homeworld We can also filter rows based on more complex conditions: starwars %&gt;% filter(species == &quot;Droid&quot; &amp; height &gt; 100) ## # A tibble: 2 × 14 ## name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_co…¹ birth…² sex gender homew…³ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 IG-88 200 140 none metal red 15 none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## # … with 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, ## # starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​eye_color, ²​birth_year, ## # ³​homeworld What if we wanted all droids, Wookiees, and Hutts? starwars %&gt;% filter(species == &quot;Droid&quot; | species == &quot;Wookiee&quot; | species == &quot;Hutt&quot;) ## # A tibble: 9 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red 33 none mascu… Naboo ## 3 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red NA none mascu… Tatooi… ## 4 Chewbacca 228 112 brown unknown blue 200 male mascu… Kashyy… ## 5 Jabba Desil… 175 1358 &lt;NA&gt; green-… orange 600 herm… mascu… Nal Hu… ## 6 IG-88 200 140 none metal red 15 none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 R4-P17 96 NA none silver… red, b… NA none femin… &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 Tarfful 234 136 brown brown blue NA male mascu… Kashyy… ## 9 BB8 NA NA none none black NA none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## # … with 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, ## # starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ## # ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld Even more simply with the %in% operator, starwars %&gt;% filter(species %in% c(&quot;Droid&quot;, &quot;Wookiee&quot;, &quot;Hutt&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 9 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red 33 none mascu… Naboo ## 3 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red NA none mascu… Tatooi… ## 4 Chewbacca 228 112 brown unknown blue 200 male mascu… Kashyy… ## 5 Jabba Desil… 175 1358 &lt;NA&gt; green-… orange 600 herm… mascu… Nal Hu… ## 6 IG-88 200 140 none metal red 15 none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 R4-P17 96 NA none silver… red, b… NA none femin… &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 Tarfful 234 136 brown brown blue NA male mascu… Kashyy… ## 9 BB8 NA NA none none black NA none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## # … with 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, ## # starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ## # ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld Notice that the original starwars dataset is never modified by any of the filter functions. None of the dplyr functions modify the dataset passed to them with the data argument. Instead, they return a new data frame with the appropriate manipulations. 9.8 Arrange rows with arrange() arrange() reorders rows in the given data frame. It takes a data frame and a set of columns names to reorder by. If you give more than one column name, additional column names are used to break ties in the values of proceeding column names. starwars %&gt;% arrange(mass, height) ## # A tibble: 87 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Ratts Tyer… 79 15 none grey, … unknown NA male mascu… Aleen … ## 2 Yoda 66 17 white green brown 896 male mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 Wicket Sys… 88 20 brown brown brown 8 male mascu… Endor ## 4 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red 33 none mascu… Naboo ## 5 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red NA none mascu… Tatooi… ## 6 Sebulba 112 40 none grey, … orange NA male mascu… Malast… ## 7 Dud Bolt 94 45 none blue, … yellow NA male mascu… Vulpter ## 8 Padmé Amid… 165 45 brown light brown 46 fema… femin… Naboo ## 9 Sly Moore 178 48 none pale white NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; Umbara ## 10 Wat Tambor 193 48 none green,… unknown NA male mascu… Skako ## # … with 77 more rows, 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ## # ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld You can use desc() to order in descending order. starwars %&gt;% arrange(desc(mass)) ## # A tibble: 87 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Jabba Desi… 175 1358 &lt;NA&gt; green-… orange 600 herm… mascu… Nal Hu… ## 2 Grievous 216 159 none brown,… green,… NA male mascu… Kalee ## 3 IG-88 200 140 none metal red 15 none mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 Darth Vader 202 136 none white yellow 41.9 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 5 Tarfful 234 136 brown brown blue NA male mascu… Kashyy… ## 6 Owen Lars 178 120 brown,… light blue 52 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 7 Bossk 190 113 none green red 53 male mascu… Trando… ## 8 Chewbacca 228 112 brown unknown blue 200 male mascu… Kashyy… ## 9 Jek Tono P… 180 110 brown fair blue NA male mascu… Bestin… ## 10 Dexter Jet… 198 102 none brown yellow NA male mascu… Ojom ## # … with 77 more rows, 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ## # ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld 9.9 Choose rows using their position with slice() Use slice to choose rows by their position. For example, to choose the character in the second row of the data frame: starwars %&gt;% slice(2) ## # A tibble: 1 × 14 ## name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_co…¹ birth…² sex gender homew…³ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… Tatooi… ## # … with 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, ## # starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​eye_color, ²​birth_year, ## # ³​homeworld The first, tenth, and twentieth rows of the data frame, starwars %&gt;% slice(c(1,10,20)) ## # A tibble: 3 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywal… 172 77 blond fair blue 19 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 Obi-Wan Ken… 182 77 auburn… fair blue-g… 57 male mascu… Stewjon ## 3 Palpatine 170 75 grey pale yellow 82 male mascu… Naboo ## # … with 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, ## # starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ## # ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld The odd rows of the data frame, starwars %&gt;% slice(seq(1,nrow(starwars), 2)) ## # A tibble: 44 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywa… 172 77 blond fair blue 19 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red 33 none mascu… Naboo ## 3 Leia Organa 150 49 brown light brown 19 fema… femin… Aldera… ## 4 Beru White… 165 75 brown light blue 47 fema… femin… Tatooi… ## 5 Biggs Dark… 183 84 black light brown 24 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 6 Anakin Sky… 188 84 blond fair blue 41.9 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 7 Chewbacca 228 112 brown unknown blue 200 male mascu… Kashyy… ## 8 Greedo 173 74 &lt;NA&gt; green black 44 male mascu… Rodia ## 9 Wedge Anti… 170 77 brown fair hazel 21 male mascu… Corell… ## 10 Yoda 66 17 white green brown 896 male mascu… &lt;NA&gt; ## # … with 34 more rows, 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ## # ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld Combine with arrange() to quickly get the character with the largest height, starwars %&gt;% arrange(desc(height)) %&gt;% slice(1) ## # A tibble: 1 × 14 ## name height mass hair_c…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Yarael Poof 264 NA none white yellow NA male mascu… Quermia ## # … with 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, ## # starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ## # ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld There are a few convenient helper versions of the slice function: slice_head slice_tail slice_sample slice_min slice_max I’ll leave it to you to pull up the help page for those functions. 9.10 Select columns with select() When you’re working with large datasets, sometimes you want to drop all of the columns you’re not using or interested in. For example, if you only wanted the species column: starwars %&gt;% select(species) ## # A tibble: 87 × 1 ## species ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Human ## 2 Droid ## 3 Droid ## 4 Human ## 5 Human ## 6 Human ## 7 Human ## 8 Droid ## 9 Human ## 10 Human ## # … with 77 more rows Or, if you wanted name, species, and homeworld: starwars %&gt;% select(name, species, homeworld) ## # A tibble: 87 × 3 ## name species homeworld ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywalker Human Tatooine ## 2 C-3PO Droid Tatooine ## 3 R2-D2 Droid Naboo ## 4 Darth Vader Human Tatooine ## 5 Leia Organa Human Alderaan ## 6 Owen Lars Human Tatooine ## 7 Beru Whitesun lars Human Tatooine ## 8 R5-D4 Droid Tatooine ## 9 Biggs Darklighter Human Tatooine ## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi Human Stewjon ## # … with 77 more rows What if you wanted all columns with the letter m in the column name? starwars %&gt;% select(contains(&quot;m&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 87 × 4 ## name mass homeworld films ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywalker 77 Tatooine &lt;chr [5]&gt; ## 2 C-3PO 75 Tatooine &lt;chr [6]&gt; ## 3 R2-D2 32 Naboo &lt;chr [7]&gt; ## 4 Darth Vader 136 Tatooine &lt;chr [4]&gt; ## 5 Leia Organa 49 Alderaan &lt;chr [5]&gt; ## 6 Owen Lars 120 Tatooine &lt;chr [3]&gt; ## 7 Beru Whitesun lars 75 Tatooine &lt;chr [3]&gt; ## 8 R5-D4 32 Tatooine &lt;chr [1]&gt; ## 9 Biggs Darklighter 84 Tatooine &lt;chr [1]&gt; ## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi 77 Stewjon &lt;chr [6]&gt; ## # … with 77 more rows See the tidyselect documentation for more selection helpers (like contains). 9.11 Rename columns with rename() rename() lets you rename columns. For example, if you wanted to rename the column “homeworld” to “home_world”: renamed_starwars &lt;- starwars %&gt;% rename(home_world=homeworld) colnames(starwars) ## [1] &quot;name&quot; &quot;height&quot; &quot;mass&quot; &quot;hair_color&quot; &quot;skin_color&quot; ## [6] &quot;eye_color&quot; &quot;birth_year&quot; &quot;sex&quot; &quot;gender&quot; &quot;homeworld&quot; ## [11] &quot;species&quot; &quot;films&quot; &quot;vehicles&quot; &quot;starships&quot; colnames(renamed_starwars) ## [1] &quot;name&quot; &quot;height&quot; &quot;mass&quot; &quot;hair_color&quot; &quot;skin_color&quot; ## [6] &quot;eye_color&quot; &quot;birth_year&quot; &quot;sex&quot; &quot;gender&quot; &quot;home_world&quot; ## [11] &quot;species&quot; &quot;films&quot; &quot;vehicles&quot; &quot;starships&quot; 9.12 Add new columns with mutate() Often, it is useful to add new columns that are functions of existing columns. For example, we could add a new column to each row that is the product of that row’s height and mass values. starwars_new_col &lt;- starwars %&gt;% mutate(heightXmass = height * mass) colnames(starwars_new_col) ## [1] &quot;name&quot; &quot;height&quot; &quot;mass&quot; &quot;hair_color&quot; &quot;skin_color&quot; ## [6] &quot;eye_color&quot; &quot;birth_year&quot; &quot;sex&quot; &quot;gender&quot; &quot;homeworld&quot; ## [11] &quot;species&quot; &quot;films&quot; &quot;vehicles&quot; &quot;starships&quot; &quot;heightXmass&quot; 9.13 Change column order with relocate() Relocate let’s you move columns around in your data set.

I would encourage you to download that Rmd file, open it own your own computer in RStudio, and run the code chunks on your own (and modify things as you wish!). Goals: Work through examples of using tidyr (and dplyr) functions to clean up messy (un-tidy) data Sources: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html R for Data Science 10.1 Setup You should have already installed the tidyverse collection of packages, which includes the tidyr package. But, if you haven’t, go ahead and run: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) In this document, we’ll be using the tidyr and dplyr packages. library(tidyr) library(dplyr) 10.2 Overview If you have not already, I suggest that you read the following article for an introduction to tidy data: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html. Additionally, I suggest that you work through the dplyr R Markdown material before working through this document. The tidyr package provides functions for making messy data “tidy”. For a complete list of the included functions, see https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html. Understanding tidy data and how to reformat your data into a tidy format is very important, as many of the functions/packages that we will use this semester are written to work with tidy-format data. For example, ggplot (the R graphics package that we will be using) assumes tidy data. Taking the time now to get comfortable with what it means to have tidy data will save you substantial time later on. 10.3 What is tidy data? You can represent the same underlying data many ways. For example, let’s say we have the following data about students’ grades: messy_grade_data1 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;lecture-material/week-03/data/messy_grades_1.csv&quot;, na.strings=&quot;&quot;) messy_grade_data1 ## name quiz1 quiz2 test1 ## 1 Billy &lt;NA&gt; D C ## 2 Suzy F &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 Lionel B C B ## 4 Jenny A A B Or, the same exact data could be structured as follows: messy_grade_data2 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;lecture-material/week-03/data/messy_grades_2.csv&quot;, na.strings=&quot;&quot;) messy_grade_data2 ## assessment Billy Suzy Lionel Jenny ## 1 quiz1 &lt;NA&gt; FALSE B A ## 2 quiz2 D NA C A ## 3 test1 C NA B B Neither of these formats are particularly convenient to work with. For example, in messy_grade_data2 format, it would be difficult to query the full set of student names in the dataset (because each student has their own column). Likewise, in messy_grade_data1, it would be diffult to query the set of assessments. From https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html, A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitative). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes. A tidy version of the grade data would look something like this: tidy_grade_data &lt;- messy_grade_data1 %&gt;% pivot_longer(c(quiz1,quiz2,test1), names_to=&quot;assessment&quot;, values_to=&quot;grade&quot;) tidy_grade_data ## # A tibble: 12 × 3 ## name assessment grade ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Billy quiz1 &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 Billy quiz2 D ## 3 Billy test1 C ## 4 Suzy quiz1 F ## 5 Suzy quiz2 &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 Suzy test1 &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 Lionel quiz1 B ## 8 Lionel quiz2 C ## 9 Lionel test1 B ## 10 Jenny quiz1 A ## 11 Jenny quiz2 A ## 12 Jenny test1 B This arrangement makes the values, variables, and observations clearer. What are the values, variables, and observations in the grade data? (the answer is here). A dataset is tidy if: Each variable has its own column Each observation has its own row Each value has its own cell In the grade data, we have the following variables: student name, assessment, and grade. Each observation is a particular student’s grade on a particular assessment (e.g., Jenny’s grade on test1). Each cell in the dataset specifies a value for a particular variable (e.g., in row 1 of tidy_grade_data, Billy is the value of the name variable). 10.4 Making data tidy Two common ways that data is messy: Column headers are values, not variable names Multiple variables are stored in one column For more common ways that data are often messy, see: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html#tidying Below, are datasets that exemplify each problem. 10.4.1 Column headers are values, not variables Observations over time are often recorded in a “wide” format. That is, each timepoint that an observation is made is entered as a column. This is convienient for data entry. For example, imagine you measure the temperature of a lake at several different depths over a 10 week period (one measurement for each depth every week). It’s convenient to enter that data in a “wide” format where each week is a column. However, this is not tidy, as each row is no longer a single observation. The billboard dataset that is loaded when you load the tidyr package is exemplifies this problem. billboard ## # A tibble: 317 × 79 ## artist track date.ent…¹ wk1 wk2 wk3 wk4 wk5 wk6 wk7 wk8 wk9 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2 Pac Baby… 2000-02-26 87 82 72 77 87 94 99 NA NA ## 2 2Ge+h… The … 2000-09-02 91 87 92 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 3 3 Doo… Kryp… 2000-04-08 81 70 68 67 66 57 54 53 51 ## 4 3 Doo… Loser 2000-10-21 76 76 72 69 67 65 55 59 62 ## 5 504 B… Wobb… 2000-04-15 57 34 25 17 17 31 36 49 53 ## 6 98^0 Give… 2000-08-19 51 39 34 26 26 19 2 2 3 ## 7 A*Tee… Danc… 2000-07-08 97 97 96 95 100 NA NA NA NA ## 8 Aaliy… I Do… 2000-01-29 84 62 51 41 38 35 35 38 38 ## 9 Aaliy… Try … 2000-03-18 59 53 38 28 21 18 16 14 12 ## 10 Adams… Open… 2000-08-26 76 76 74 69 68 67 61 58 57 ## # … with 307 more rows, 67 more variables: wk10 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk11 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk12 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # wk13 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk14 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk15 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk16 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk17 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk18 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # wk19 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk20 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk21 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk22 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk23 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk24 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # wk25 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk26 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk27 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk28 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk29 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk30 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # wk31 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk32 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk33 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk34 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk35 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk36 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # wk37 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk38 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk39 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk40 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk41 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk42 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # wk43 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk44 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk45 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk46 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk47 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk48 &lt;dbl&gt;, … The billboard dataset records the date a song enters the billboard top 100. First on your own, use the pivot_longer function to create a tidy version of the billboard dataset. The solution can be found here. 10.4.2 Multiple variables are stored in one column Sometimes, the values in a column describe multiple variables. For example, in the following messy dataset, the month and day of each temperature recording are combined under a single column. messy_temperature &lt;- read.csv(&quot;lecture-material/week-03/data/multi_variables_single_col.csv&quot;) messy_temperature ## date year temperature ## 1 jan1 2022 15 ## 2 jan14 2022 130 ## 3 feb1 2022 19 ## 4 feb14 2022 85 ## 5 mar1 2022 95 ## 6 mar14 2022 130 ## 7 apr1 2022 29 ## 8 apr14 2022 42 ## 9 may1 2022 138 ## 10 may14 2022 14 ## 11 jun1 2022 133 ## 12 jun14 2022 53 ## 13 jul1 2022 120 ## 14 jul14 2022 108 ## 15 aug1 2022 23 ## 16 aug14 2022 148 ## 17 sep1 2022 103 ## 18 sep14 2022 113 ## 19 nov1 2022 67 ## 20 nov14 2022 1 ## 21 oct1 2022 113 ## 22 oct14 2022 56 ## 23 dec1 2022 107 ## 24 dec14 2022 30 The first three characters of the “date” column give the month, and the following numeric value gives the day of the month of the temperature reading. We can use the separate function to properly split the date column into multiple columns. tidy_temperature &lt;- messy_temperature %&gt;% separate(col=date, into=c(&quot;month&quot;,&quot;day&quot;), sep=3) tidy_temperature ## month day year temperature ## 1 jan 1 2022 15 ## 2 jan 14 2022 130 ## 3 feb 1 2022 19 ## 4 feb 14 2022 85 ## 5 mar 1 2022 95 ## 6 mar 14 2022 130 ## 7 apr 1 2022 29 ## 8 apr 14 2022 42 ## 9 may 1 2022 138 ## 10 may 14 2022 14 ## 11 jun 1 2022 133 ## 12 jun 14 2022 53 ## 13 jul 1 2022 120 ## 14 jul 14 2022 108 ## 15 aug 1 2022 23 ## 16 aug 14 2022 148 ## 17 sep 1 2022 103 ## 18 sep 14 2022 113 ## 19 nov 1 2022 67 ## 20 nov 14 2022 1 ## 21 oct 1 2022 113 ## 22 oct 14 2022 56 ## 23 dec 1 2022 107 ## 24 dec 14 2022 30 Run ?separate to see how the separate function works. Adding extra columns doesn’t “untidy” your data. Sometimes it is useful to add additional aggregate labels to an observation (especially when working with dates). For example, it might be useful to add a proper date column (with the format YEAR-MONTH-DAY) to our tidied temperature data. I’ll leave that as an exercise for you to do on your own. You’ll need to map each month string to its numeric representation (e.g. jan = 1, feb = 2). Then you can use mutate to create a new column from the relevant columns.

However, we have overviewed broad categories of data mining tasks. My advice is to start by choosing a domain that is interesting to you and a type of data mining task that you think is applicable (and that you are interested in learning more about). You will then need to do your own research on the specifics. Some example types of projects (your project does not need to fall under any of these categories) Solve a problem E.g., Design and apply a data mining pipeline to a particular problem you are interested in, and then evaluate your approach by comparing to another method. Replicate (and/or extend) a published study E.g., identify a published study that you are interested in and independently replicate some portion of it (you must create your own pipeline to do so, not just reuse the original authors’). Answer a research question E.g., formulate a hypothesis and design (and apply) a data mining approach to test your hypothesis. Analysis E.g., design a data mining pipeline for some task (or use an existing pipeline) and analyze how/why it works (or doesn’t work). You might try swapping out individual components of the pipeline for alternative techniques, add noise to the dataset, etc, etc. E.g., design an experiment to analyze the properties of different similarity metrics and their effect on a data mining algorithm You are welcome to drop by office hours to chat about project ideas!

I expect your project to be well-researched, appropriate, and achievable in the given time frame. If you’re unsure, come chat with me during office hours! I expect you to either collect your own dataset or use a publicly available dataset. I expect you to evaluate your data mining approach in some way. Conducting a small study that compares your approach to an alternative approach, Assessing the accuracy of your model by holding back validation data, Assessing the robustness of your model, Etc. I expect you to effectively communicate your methodology and findings in a final report. This will take the form of a well-organized and well-written explanations with publication-quality visualzations. I will consider the overall difficulty of your project when determining whether or not it is sufficient (or infeasible) for your final project. For example, if your are collecting your own data, your pipeline will need to be simpler because of the extra time and effort requried for data collection. 13.2 Proposal guidelines Your project proposal should be under 3 pages, be formatted under the following headings, and address each of the following points: Project overview Provide an overview of your project. What is the application domain you are working on? What specific problem are you working on? Briefly, what is your overall approach? Why? What is your motivation? What are your goals for this project? Related work What similar projects have been attempted in your proposed domain? How do they related to your project? Data plan What data do you plan to use for your project? If you plan on collecting your own data, how do you plan to do so? If you plan to use an existing dataset, which dataset do you plan to use and why? Who collected your data and for what original purpose? What proprocessing do you expect to need to perform on your data? Implementation plan Describe your proposed data mining pipeline How will you implement your data mining pipeline? What components do you plan to use existing software/libraries for? Which software/libraries do you plan to use? Evaluation plan How do you plan to evaluate your data mining algorithm? Provide a broad overview of how you plan to evaluate your approach. How will you measure success? Will you compare to an alternative method? Measure accuracy with a ground truth testing set? Plan for group collaboration What is your plan for collaborating as a group? Do you plan to meet regularly in-person, over zoom, or coordinate asynchronously on a messaging application like discord? How do you plan to collaboratively implement your data mining pipeline? How will you manage your code and your data? Timeline Outline your week-by-week goals for completing your project by the final report deadline Feel free to communicate this timeline as a bulleted list, a table, etc. References List your references. Include a project title and the members of your group as part of your proposal. Your proposal should be organized into clearly labeled sections (one to address each of the eight categories above). Each section should be written in paragraph form (with the exception of the references and the timeline section where you may opt to use a list or a table). Your proposal will be graded on the quality of your writing as well as your answers to the previously listed prompts. It should be evident that your group has thoroughly researched the area and formulated a plan to achieve your goals. I recognize that things may change during the course of the project, but I’m looking here to make sure you have a solid initial plan. Any significant project like this requires significant prework before implementation. 13.3 Grading The proposal will be graded as follows (out of 100): Item Points Project overview section addresses required points 10 Related work section addresses required points 15 Data plan section addresses required points 10 Implementation plan section addresses required points 15 Evaluation plan section addresses required points 10 Plan for group collaboration section addresses required points 10 Timeline section addresses required points 10 Related work and references are included and cited appropriately 5 Writing is appropriately formal 5 Writing is clear 5 Proposal is well-formatted 5 I reserve the right to award flex points for exemplary work in any areas of this project.

If you want to deviate from this structure for some reason, you need to speak with me ahead of time (at least a week before the deadline). Good reasons for deviating from the required sections would be if you plan to submit your work to a conference or competition that requires a different organization, you are creating an interactive document that lends itself to a different organization. Below, I outline the points you must address in each section: 16.2.1 Introduction Your introduction should: introduce your application domain and the specific problem you’re working on, providing enough background for readers to understand the value of your project motivate your project overview your approach overview your results 16.2.2 Related work Your related work section should: discuss previous work done that relates to your project. For example, alternative approaches to the problem you’re trying to solve other examples of your particular approach in your domain or in another domain include a minimum of three relevant references to academic publications Your related work should include appropriate references to academic publications (e.g., found using google scholar, pubmed, etc.) A good related work section will likely reference (and overview) several related academic publications. 16.2.3 Methods Your methods section should: describe how you chose your data and/or how you collected your data describe your data mining pipeline in sufficient detail such that someone could replicate your project What data preprocessing did you perform? Which data mining algorithms did you apply (and how)? What postprocessing did you do? describe any analyses you performed to evaluate your model describe the software You may wish to include diagrams that overview methodology. 16.2.4 Results and discussion You results and discussion section should: - describe your results - discuss how your results fit into a broader context - should include publication-quality visualizations that effectively communicate your results - Depending on the format you use for your final report, you may also wish to embed interactive visualizations. For example, you might present the performance of your data mining approach and discuss how it compares to a baseline/alternative method. 16.2.5 Conclusion Your conclusion should: very briefly summarize your findings discuss any limitations/shortcomings of your approach/experiments suggest future work (e.g., possible extensions to your project) 16.2.6 Data and software availability Your data and software availability section should: provide a working link to where your software can be found and downloaded (e.g., a github repository) provide a working link to where your data can be downloaded If either of those are not feasible for your project (e.g., you collected your own dataset and it’s huge), let me know at least a week before the deadline (the sooner you let me know, the better). 16.2.7 References Your references should be consistenly formatted such that a reader can find each reference (e.g., include authors, year, title, venue/journal, DOI). If you use Rmd, Bookdown, or LaTex to create your report, I can help you configure things such that your references are automatically formatted for you. 16.3 Deliverables Submit your report through Blackboard. If your report is a .pdf file, attach it to the submission. If your report is a live webpage, include a (working) link. One submission per group. Include in the comments section of the assignment the names of the group members. As part of your report, you will need to include working links to your code and data (e.g., in a github repository). 16.4 Grading Your final report will be graded on the following out of 100: Item Points Title accurately describes your project/findings 5 Introduction 10 Related work 10 Methods 10 Results and discussion 10 Conclusion 10 Data and software availability 10 References are consistently formatted 5 Code can be compiled/executed using provided instructions 10 Report is well-organized into proper sections, paragraphs follow logical structure 10 Report is sufficiently professional (few spelling and gramatical errors) 10 I reserve the right to award flex points for exemplary work in any areas of this project. All components of your final project are subject to GVSU and the School of Computing’s academic honesty policies. Violations of these policies may result in failure from the course.
