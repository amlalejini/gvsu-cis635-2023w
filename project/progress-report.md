# Final project - Mid-project update

The goal of this progress report is for you to have space to reflect on your progress so far and plan.
You should be working on your final project consistently instead of leaving everything to the end of the semester.
The progress report is a mechanism to make that more likely.

You should not wait for my feedback on your progress update before resuming work on your project ðŸ™‚

## Requirements

Your progress update should be approximately one to two pages of text and address the following:

- **Progress so far**
  - What have you completed so far?
  - Provide a link to your data so far
  - Provide a link to your code so far (e.g., github repository, etc)
- **Challenges**
  - Have you run into any challenges so far? Has anything taken longer than expected?
  - How have you overcome these challenges?
  - If there are any current challenges you have not yet overcome, how do you plan to overcome them?
- **Collaboration** (if applicable)
  - How frequently does your group meet?
  - Does everyone feel like each group member is contributing meaningfully to the project? If not, how does your group plan address this problem?
- **Next steps**
  - What do you still need to complete for your project?
  - What is your plan to complete your project?
  - Do you forsee any potential challenges?

Organize your progress report into sections (one for each of the categories above).
