# Final project - Survey

Before completing this survey, read over the descriptions for each part of the project:
[include links to descriptions].

Have you carefully read over each of the following descriptions: ...?

## Interests

What application domains are you interested in? Are there particular types of problems you are interested in solving?

What types of data are you interested in working with?

What data mining algorithms are you interested in?

What areas do you consider to be your strengths? E.g., coding in a particular language, writing, organization, searching for and reading academic literature, et cetera.

## Brainstorming

**Brainstorm at least 3 _different_ project ideas.** Describe each project idea. In each description, be sure to address the following questions:

- What is the goal of the project?
- What is the application domain or problem you would be working on?
- What type of data would you use? Would you collect data yourself or use publicly available data?
- What data mining techniques would you use?
- How would you evaluate or analyze your methodology?

You do not need to end up working on any of these project ideas, and your descriptions do not need to be technical.
These are (1) meant to get you thinking about possible project directions, and (2) to give you a starting place when you start to put together your project proposal.

## Expectations

What final project grade(s) would you see as a success?

What software do you like to use to manage group work? E.g., GitHub, BitBucket, Overleaf, Google Drive, etc

## Group assignment

Would you like to be assigned a group or work individually?

If you would like to be assigned a group, is there anyone in particular you would like to work with? (the request should be mutual for me to match you)

If you would like to be assigned a group, is there anyone in particular that you would _not_ like to work with?

If you would like to be assigned a group, would you be okay with a third group member if there are an odd number of individuals who want to work in a group?
