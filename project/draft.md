# Final project - Report draft

This draft of your report is your opportunity to get my feedback on your report.
Your draft does not need to be complete.
I will give you feedback on it regardless of the state you turn it in (though, it does need to be well organized with proper section headings to facilitate me being able to give feedback).

The more complete of a report you turn in, the more detailed feedback I can give you for what you need to do in order to earn the grade you want on your final report.
For example, if you turn in a complete draft of your final report, I can tell you what grade you would receive if you turned it in as your final report and tell you where improvements can/need to be made.

If your project is not complete by the time you turn in your draft, you should not wait for my feedback on your draft  before resuming work on your project ðŸ™‚

## Grading

Your draft will be graded primarily on

1. Effort: turned it in on time, draft contains meaningful content relevant to your final report, and it is clear that you have completed a meaningful amount of your project
  - I can't give meaningful feedback if you don't submit a meaningful draft.
  - I cannot give full credit for effort if you do not demonstrate that you have at least completed some meaningful portion of your project.
2. Organization: clearly organized with proper section headings, text is readable
  - I can't give you useful feedback if your draft is not organized in a reasonable way.

Graded on the following out of 100:

| Item | Points |
| --- | --- |
| Effort | 80 |
| Document is clearly organized | 20 |
