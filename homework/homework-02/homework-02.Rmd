# Homework 2

## Overview

This goal of this homework is as follows:

- Give you an opportunity to practice some R programming basics
- Make sure you are comfortable creating and knitting an R Markdown document

### Grading

- Uploaded requested files, 5%
- File is properly/clearly formatted, 10%
  - Proper section headers for each part of your homework
  - You clearly indicate which question each of your responses is associated with
  - **Look at your compiled pdf before submitting it. Make sure it looks well-formatted.**
  - For this assignment, formatting is particularly important because it's something you'll need to know how to do well in R markdown going forward.
- Programming questions: 85%, all weighted evenly

## Setup

Make sure you have access to a computer with R and RStudio installed (with the ability to install new packages).
If you do not, let me know as soon as possible!

If you have not done so already, install R and RStudio (step-by-step guides provided in week 1 course content).

I strongly encourage you to stay organized.
I recommend that you directory on your computer where you can save all of your work for this class (e.g., "cis635" would make for a good name).
Within that directory, I recommend keeping each of your homework assignments and projects separated into their own directories.
For example, I might organize things as follows:

```
cis635/
  homeworks/
    hw01
    hw02
    ...
  project/
    ...
```

Create a new R Markdown file with the title "Homework 2" and with you as the author (hint: this information will go into your R Markdown frontmatter at the top of the file).
In your R markdown file, create a section heading for each of the following parts of your homework:

- Part A. Use R as a calculator
- Part B. Built-in Functions
- Part C. Creating vectors
- Part D. Subsetting vectors
- Part E. Types of data

## Part A. Use R as a calculator

**Under your Part A heading**, write one code chunk for each of the following calculations:

1. $$ 1+2(3+4) $$
2. $$ log_2(4^3 + 3^{2+1}) $$
3. $$ \sqrt{(4+3)(2+1)} $$

For example, if the calculation is `2 + 2`, your code chunk should look something like this when your R Markdown document is compiled:

```{r}
2+2
```

I want to see each equation _translated directly into code_.
Do not simplify any of the calculations (e.g., `2+1` should be `2+1` in your code, not `3`).

## Part B. Built-in Functions

A built-in function is one that comes pre-loaded in R (you don't need to install and load a package to use).
To learn how to use a built-in loaded function that you don't know how to use appropriately, use the `help()` function.
`help()` takes one parameter, the name of the function that you want information about (e.g., `help(abs)`).
Instead of the help function, you could also use enter `?` and then the name of the function in your R console (e.g., `?abs`).

Familiarize yourself with the built-in functions `abs()`, `round()`, `sqrt()`, `tolower()`, and `toupper()`.

**Under your Part B heading**, use these built-in functions to write code that prints the following items (put each of these into a different code chunk in your R Markdown document):

1. The absolute value of -15.5.
2. 4.483847 rounded to one decimal place. The function `round()` takes two arguments, the number to be rounded and the number of decimal places.
3. "species" in all capital letters.
4. "SPECIES" in all lower case letters.

## Part C. Creating vectors

**Under your Part C heading,** Create the following vectors using just `seq()` and/or `rep()`. (don't use `c()`)

1. Positive integers from 1 to 99
2. Odd integers between 1 and 99
3. The numbers `1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3` (hint: read the help pages for `seq` and `rep`!)

## Part D. Subsetting vectors

**Under your Part D heading,** use subsetting syntax (square brackets) to write code that completes the following using the vector `y`.

```
y <- c(3,2,15,-1,22,1,9,17,5)
```

1. Display only the first value of `y`.
2. Display the last value of `y`, in a way that would work if `y` were any length. (hint: `?length`)
3. Display only the values in `y` that are greater than the mean of `y`.

## Part E. Types of data

**Under your part E heading,** using the vector `y` write code that completes the following tasks:

```{r}
y <- c(3,2,15,-1,22,1,9,17,5)
```

1. Make a logical (TRUE/FALSE) vector describing which values in y are positive.
2. Make a logical vector describing whether any of the values of y are equal to the mean of y.
3. Coerce the vector you just made (in #2 above) from a logical vector to a character vector.
4. Make a logical vector describing whether any of the values of y are equal to the median of y.
5. Coerce the vector you just made (in #4 above) into a categorial vector (using `factor()`).
6. Make a matrix with 4 rows and 3 columns that looks like this:

    ```
    ##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
    ## [1,]    1    2    3
    ## [2,]    4    5    6
    ## [3,]    7    8    9
    ## [4,]   10   11   12
    ```

7. Coerce that matrix into a dataframe.
