Each of these articles is uploaded as a pdf under Week 8's weekly content.

1. Birhane, Abeba. "Algorithmic Injustice: A Relational Ethics Approach." Patterns 2, no. 2 (February 2021): 100205. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100205.
2. Mitchell, Margaret, Simone Wu, Andrew Zaldivar, Parker Barnes, Lucy Vasserman, Ben Hutchinson, Elena Spitzer, Inioluwa Deborah Raji, and Timnit Gebru. “Model Cards for Model Reporting.” In Proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, 220–29. Atlanta GA USA: ACM, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1145/3287560.3287596.

Answer the following questions.
Your responses should be in complete sentences.
None of your responses need to be more than a paragraph, but it should be clear that you have read and made an effort to understand the chosen paper.

Do not copy sentences from the paper into your answers unless you have good reason and make it clear that you are quoting the paper.
Your responses should be in _your own_ words.

1. Which paper did you select?
2. Why did you choose to read the paper you selected?
3. In your own words (1 - 2 paragraphs), what is the paper about? E.g., what are the goals and/or findings?
4. How could you apply the ideas presented in the article to your own future data mining projects (in this class and/or beyond the classroom)? Provide specific examples.
